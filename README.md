This project features an **Interactive Excel-based dashboard for BlinkIT**, providing insights into grocery sales performance. Built entirely using Microsoft Excel, the dashboard visualizes key metrics such as total sales, average sales, number of items, and average ratings.
It allows users to filter data by outlet size, location, item type, and more using slicers.
The dashboard includes detailed visualizations of sales trends, outlet performance, and item categories, enabling effective business decision-making. This project demonstrates proficiency in Excel analytics and dashboard creation without the use of external tools or coding.
